				<h3>We are a part of your community</h3>

				<p>Pack 374 has been active in the Cambrian Park neighborhood of San Jose since 1954.</p>

				<p>Our year-round family scouting program is designed for boys who are in the first through the fifth grades. We recruit primarily from Oster, Carlton, and Sartorette, but our scouts also represent other local public and private schools.</p>

				<p>We are a non-denominational Pack, and have boys from many faiths.</p>

				<h3>Activities and Meetings</h3>

				<p>We meet together as a full Pack (all grade levels) once per month, typically on the 4th Friday, at our charter organization, the <a href="http://www.cambrianparkumc.org/">Cambrian Park United Methodist Church</a>. The Pack Meeting is a time to celebrate our individual and den achievements, tell jokes, sing songs, and have fun!</p>

				<p>We meet twice per month for grade-level specific activities, as organized by each Den. Scouts in a Den work together on their rank Adventures, earning advancement and awards along the way. Dens usually meet at the church, but they also organize outings together, which could be hiking, fishing, or touring a local fire house or police station.</p>

				<p>We try to plan one Pack-level event each month outside the Pack Meeting. Activities include service projects like Scouting for Food and National River Clean-up Day, fun events like the Pinewood Derby and San Jose Giants or San Jose Earthquakes games, and community events like the Los Gatos Holiday Parade.</p>

				<p>Also, some activities required for Adventure advancement are designed to be done at home, with your family.</p>
